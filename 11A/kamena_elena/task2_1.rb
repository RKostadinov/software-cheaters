1. You are giving an argument for a folder with files;
	1.1 if ther are other arguments they should be disc–∞rded
2. some files names in this folder are in the format First_Last_digits.rb. But there are also other files;
3. for each student calculate the DIGIT and write in CSV file only those that have sum more than 10;
4. in HTML file write those students that have DIGIT's sum less than 10;
5. the results must include the student's names and the DIGIT's sum;
6. sort the results by DIGIT's sum ASC for both folders;
7. The HTML file must be names result.html;
8. The CSV file must be named result.csv:


		FirstName5,LastName5,sum1
		FirstName2,LastName2,sum2
		FirstName9,LastName9,sum3
		...
		FirstName,LastName,sumN

Good luck!
